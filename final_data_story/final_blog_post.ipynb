    "## Introduction ðŸ‘‹\n",
    "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, in many ways, come as a day of reckoning for the people of the United States. Poltical polarization, social upheaval, and widespread uncertainty has affected many in unprecedented ways. Perhaps many months of quarantine and lockdowns haas driven millions of Americans deeper into their own circles of digital media influence. The first 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have already been administered, and there are nonetheless, a variety of sentiments concerning its, efficacy and safety, as well as the motives of its creators. As the conversation unfolds against the backdrop of this historical time, it is clear that there is much to learn about the people of the U.S., and about the dynamics of trust amid a crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covering the Conversation ðŸ’¬  \n",
    "There is a tremendous amount of potential in modern micro-blogging. Short-form content created by millions of users enables the analysis of large corpora of human language in real time. This study, therefore, aims to gauge the state of the conversation surrounding the anti-vaccination movement by analyzing data that has been scraped from Twitter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two distinct sets of tweets have been selected, one spanning rougly a year since the start of the pandemic, and the other spanning a time frame extending from 2015 to 2016. The latter time period coincides with the passing and full enactment of California Senate Bill 277, which excluded an American parent's personal belief as a justification to exempt children immunizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that analysis of these tweets will indicate a greater sense of levity, as well as more nuanced modes of skepticism concerning the coronavirus vaccine as opposed to previous immunizations. Amid the perception of a global threat, it is also likely that more people will lean on the counsel of celebrities and organizational leaders when they are unsure of whom to trust. The subsequent analyses will seek to elucidate the veracity of such hypotheses."
